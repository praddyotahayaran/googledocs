This project is a clone of google docs toolbar.

Tools that I have used to build this project

1. React
2. Quill

Quill: Quill is a free, open source WYSIWYG (a type of editing software that allows users to see and edit content in a form that appears as it would when displayed on an interface, webpage, slide presentation or printed document) editor.
